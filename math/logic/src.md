*Prerequisites.* Most content on this topic assumes some mathematical proof techniques (incl. mathematical induction) and basic knowledge of naive set theory. The following books might be a good refresher:
(The first book also provides a basic introduction to sentential (propositional) logic; The second book, as a treatment of naive set theory, actually utilizes axioms.)

* Daniel J. Velleman.
***How to Prove It: A Structured Approach.***
* Paul Halmos.
***Naive Set Theory.***

At a later point, our informal approaches to reasoning such as the induction principle, and the unrestricted use of "naive" sets will be properly justified and formalized by proof theory and axiomatic set theory. So these prerequisites are really just a minimal to bootstrap our study on logic.
